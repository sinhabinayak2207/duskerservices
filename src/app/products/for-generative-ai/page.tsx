    faqs: [
      {
        id: 1,
        question: "What types of generative AI models does Scale support?",
        answer: "Scale supports a wide range of generative AI models including large language models (LLMs), text-to-image models, text-to-video models, multimodal models, and more. Our platform is designed to be model-agnostic, allowing you to work with both open-source and proprietary models across different architectures and capabilities."
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        question: "How does Scale's data differ from publicly available datasets?",
        answer: "Scale's datasets are specifically curated for generative AI applications with a focus on quality, diversity, and specialized use cases. Our data undergoes rigorous cleaning, validation, and annotation processes to ensure it meets the highest standards. We also offer custom data collection and curation services for specific domains and requirements that aren't well-served by public datasets."
      },
      {
        id: 3,
        question: "What is RLHF and why is it important for generative AI?",
        answer: "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a technique used to align AI models with human preferences and values. It involves collecting human feedback on model outputs and using that feedback to further train the model. RLHF is crucial for improving the helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty of generative AI systems, reducing harmful outputs, and ensuring the models behave in ways that users find valuable."
      },
      {
        id: 4,
        question: "How does Scale ensure the safety of generative AI models?",
        answer: "Scale employs a multi-layered approach to AI safety including comprehensive testing frameworks, red-teaming exercises, adversarial testing, and continuous monitoring. Our safety evaluations cover areas such as harmful content generation, bias, toxicity, factuality, and security vulnerabilities. We also provide tools for implementing safety guardrails and content filtering in production systems."
      },
      {
        id: 5,
        question: "Can Scale help with deploying generative AI in regulated industries?",
        answer: "Yes, Scale has extensive experience helping organizations in regulated industries such as healthcare, finance, and government deploy generative AI solutions. We provide specialized tools and workflows for compliance documentation, audit trails, explainability, and risk management. Our team can work with you to ensure your AI implementations meet regulatory requirements while delivering business value."
