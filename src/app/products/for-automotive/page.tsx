      {
        id: 1,
        question: "What types of sensor data can Scale process for automotive applications?",
        answer: "Scale can process all major sensor types used in autonomous vehicles including cameras (RGB, infrared, thermal), LiDAR (various manufacturers and specifications), radar, ultrasonic sensors, and GPS/IMU data. Our platform is designed to handle multi-sensor fusion tasks and synchronize data across different sensor modalities with precise temporal alignment."
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        question: "How does Scale ensure the quality and accuracy of annotations for safety-critical automotive applications?",
        answer: "We employ a multi-layered quality assurance process including specialized training for automotive annotators, consensus-based annotation for critical objects, regular calibration exercises, automated quality checks, and manual reviews by domain experts. For safety-critical projects, we can implement additional verification steps and customized quality metrics specific to your requirements."
      },
      {
        id: 3,
        question: "Can Scale help with regulatory compliance for autonomous vehicle development?",
        answer: "Yes, Scale provides comprehensive documentation and traceability for data processing and model development that can support regulatory compliance efforts. Our platform maintains detailed audit trails, version control, and data lineage information. We also offer specialized workflows for safety validation that align with industry standards such as ISO 26262 and SOTIF (ISO/PAS 21448)."
      },
      {
        id: 4,
        question: "How does Scale's edge case discovery work for automotive applications?",
        answer: "Our edge case discovery combines automated detection algorithms with human review to identify rare but critical scenarios in your data. We use a combination of statistical outlier detection, model confidence analysis, and specialized heuristics for automotive-specific scenarios. Once identified, edge cases are cataloged, annotated with high precision, and can be used for targeted testing and model improvement."
      },
      {
        id: 5,
        question: "Can Scale integrate with our existing automotive development tools and workflows?",
        answer: "Absolutely. Scale's platform is designed to integrate seamlessly with common automotive development tools and workflows. We offer APIs and connectors for major simulation environments, data storage systems, ML frameworks, and CI/CD pipelines. Our team can work with you to develop custom integrations for proprietary tools and ensure a smooth workflow from data collection to model deployment."
